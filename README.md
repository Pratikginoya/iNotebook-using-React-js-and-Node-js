# iNotebook Using React.js & Node.js

Hello! I am Pratik Ginoya. This is my React.js & Node.js project, iNotebook. Through this project, I have learned advanced React.js concepts for the front-end and Node.js for the back-end.

## About the project

- In this React-Node project, users can sign-up, log-in and view their notes.
- They can also add, edit, or delete notes for future reference.
- All data is stored on the server side through the APIs.

## Back-end (using Node.js) :-
First, I built a backend using Node.js with MongoDB. I used MongoDB as the database and implemented key concepts such as middleware and authentication tokens. I also created RESTful APIs for user login and signup, including generating authentication tokens. Additionally, I developed an API for CRUD operations on notes.
- You can find this Node.js project in the Backend folder of this repository.
  
Here some screenshots of backend for your reference...

## Front-end (using React.js) :-
After above task, I completed the Front-end with React.js, which consumes the RESTful APIs from the Node.js backend. This project features advanced React.js concepts, such as context stores and custom hooks.
